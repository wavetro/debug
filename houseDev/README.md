# How to set this up:

- Clone or download this folder of files

- Open a terminal in the folder

- Run `npm i vite`, `npm i @babylonjs/core`, `npm i @babylonjs/loaders`, `npm i ammojs-typed`

- Run `npm run dev` to make sure Vite launches

- Uncomment lines 39 and 40 to find the AmmoJS error that's driving me crazy *(ideally a solution where I can pull from the `kripken/ammo.js` [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/) directly instead of from `ammojs-typed`, but anything helps)*
